    <p><strong>Description:</strong>Chicken biryani is a popular rice dish from the Indian subcontinent. It is made with basmati rice, chicken, and a variety of spices. The rice is cooked separately from the chicken, and then they are layered together with the spices. The dish is then cooked in a sealed pot, which helps to infuse the flavors.</p>
